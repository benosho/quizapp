Synopsis:

The quiz App grades user response to quiz questions. My quiz App tests knowledge about fire safety.
Different input types are used to capture user responses. I developed this App during the 7 Days of Code Challenge
of the Google Africa Scholarship Program. The Challenge tests skills learnt on the Android Basic course by Udacity.

Design:

The quiz contains 10 questions. A point is scored when a question is correctly answered. A maximum of 10 points
can be scored. Quiz scores pop-up on the screen when the "Get Score" button is clicked. The App is single screen. 
Radio buttons, check boxes and text fields are used to capture user responses. The questions and correct responses are listed
in the "Quiz Questions & Answers" section.

To keep code to a minimum, arrays and collections were used. This required reviewing the Java documentation and borrowing code snippets
from sites like Stack Overflow. Specifically arrays and collections were used to store user responses and expected responses.
Array and collection methods were also useful in comparing user responses with expected responses.
